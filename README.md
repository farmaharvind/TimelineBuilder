# Timeline Builder

## Overview
**Timeline Builder** is a Python script that helps generate interactive timelines based on data inputs. It leverages `pandas` for data manipulation, `plotly` for visualizations, and various other libraries for processing and formatting. The script can be used to create detailed, graphical representations of events, projects, or other sequential data.

## Features
- Generate interactive timelines using Plotly
- Support for data input from various sources (e.g., JSON, CSV)
- Easy customization of timeline visuals
- Environment variable support for sensitive information
- Handles date parsing and data processing seamlessly

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- `pipenv` for managing dependencies
